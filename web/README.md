# mancalapy - frontend

Frontend written in pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS. We use Flask with Jinja for simplicity.

The frontend has 3 views:
1. MENU: The first stage, highlights the menu and the options available.
2. IN GAME: After a match has started, shows the board and the mancalas.
3. GAME FINISHED: Still WiP, this view should show the player that won the match and the option for a rematch.
4. HOW TO PLAY: A always visible button toggles the section that explains how to play the game.
